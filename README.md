# CS-255 System Design and Analysis



## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was a software development project for a client in the transportation industry. The client wanted the development of a web-based system that would allow them to manage their drivers' training and certification requirements. The system would include features such as tracking and reporting on drivers' progress, managing training materials and scheduling training sessions. The system would also allow for the creation and management of custom training plans based on the specific needs of individual drivers.
## What did you do particularly well?
In my opinion, I successfully identified both the requirements of the users and the overall objectives of the program in this situation. Throughout the project, I constantly kept the user's needs at the forefront of my mind. The users' satisfaction was given top priority when designing the project, as can be seen in the way the systems are integrated and the built-in redundancies that ensure user accuracy and contentment.
## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Regarding the project documents, if I were to select one aspect to improve, I would focus on enhancing the clarity of some of the diagrams. I think that incorporating additional diagrams to break down the information into smaller, more easily digestible sections would help to make certain connections and sets of information clearer. To provide an overall picture of the interactions between these sub-diagrams, a primary set of diagrams could then be employed. By doing so, I believe that the diagrams in the project would be much more comprehensible and lucid.
To further elaborate, I think that the diagrams in the project documentation could have been more effective in conveying the necessary information if they were cleaner and more organized. There were instances where certain sets of information were clustered together, making it difficult to distinguish between the different components. By breaking down the information into smaller sub-diagrams and then using an overall set of diagrams to show the main interactions between them, the overall clarity of the project's diagrams could be improved.
## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Regarding interpreting user needs and putting them into practice, I began by using the information obtained from the initial interview to understand the requirements of the different users. From there, I analyzed the system's functionality. In addition to being an analyst, I also assumed the role of a consumer, administrator, IT support, and educator to identify their needs in this type of project. The importance of identifying user needs in a project lies in ensuring that the program is not only functional and usable but also enjoyable for everyone involved. If I failed to deliver on this, then there would have been a gap in analyzing and designing the project.
## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Regarding my approach to software design, I strive to balance innovation and practicality by incorporating novel ideas and features into a program without completely overhauling the existing code or structure. Rather, I aim to differentiate the program by emphasizing how the code is utilized and how that translates to a better experience for end-users.

Moving forward, I plan to adopt a multi-step process to analyze and design systems. First, I would conduct thorough research on the program's purpose and goals, then follow up with an interview to determine the client's needs and wants. Clear communication at every stage of the project is critical to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that we can add or remove features as necessary. Once the requirements are established, I would proceed to design the program.

Finally, I believe that utilizing graphical representations, such as diagrams, is essential to help both the client and the design team visualize the system's structure and functionality. This approach can improve understanding, increase buy-in from stakeholders, and contribute to the project's success.
